As a graduate research assistant at Ingenuity Labs Research Institute and a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Queen's University, I am passionate about developing innovative solutions for complex problems in the field of Robotics using artificial intelligence and data science. I have a strong background in computer science, and teamwork, as demonstrated by my work experience and publications. My research interests include information fusion, uncertainty quantification, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics. I aim to advance the state-of-the-art in these fields and to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and opportunities.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
