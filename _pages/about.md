As a graduate research assistant at [Ingenuity Labs Research Institute](https://ingenuitylabs.queensu.ca/) and a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca), I am passionate about developing innovative solutions for complex problems in the field of field robotics. I have a strong background in control and computer science, and teamwork, as demonstrated by my work experience and publications. My research interests include `Filed Robotics`, `Physical AI`, `SLAM`, and `Autonomous Construction Vehicles`. I aim to advance the state-of-the-art in these fields and to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and opportunities.
